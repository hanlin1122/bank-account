# Basic Checking and Savings Account Simulation

**Overview**

This repository contains Java code and documentation for simulating the creation of a bank account and common banking tasks, such as deposit and withdrawl. Within this project, there exists two Java classes: one that simulates a checking account (BankAccount.java) and another that simulates a savings account (SavingsAccount.java). The savings account class extends to the checking account class to simulate a real-life banking scenario. Both classes include a function that prints a report for all relevant information regarding inputed user.

Banking has become an essential part of people's everyday lives. As more people are diversifying their money into certificate of deposits (CDs), high-yield saving accounts, and investment banks, having banking information, banking has become a difficult and complex process. Thus, basic interest functions can increase efficicency by automating the interest-yield process and reach a faster compile time, which in this simulation means faster access to bank reports.
